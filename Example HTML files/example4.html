<h1 id="about-docscanner">About Docscanner</h1>
<p>Docscanner allows you to streamline your documentation workflow by detecting words or phrases listed in a <em>.csv</em> file in an inputted <em>.html</em> file. If any words/phrases are detected, Docscanner returns both the word/phrase as well as the line number that it is located on. This helps eliminate human error when applying style guide content standards in a documentation project. </p>
<p>The script is case insensitive and is also capable of finding duplicate words/phrases on the same line in the <em>.html</em> file. </p>
